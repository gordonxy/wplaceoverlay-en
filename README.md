# Wplace Overlay Script

A user script (Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey) that enhances the experience on the `wplace.live` website by allowing a custom image overlay on the screen. With this script, you can load a template, adjust its position, size, opacity, and blend mode, making collaborative art creation easier.

All settings, including the image, are saved locally in your browser so you don‚Äôt need to reconfigure everything on each visit.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Choose Local Image**: Load any image from your computer to be used as an overlay.
- **Adjustable Opacity**: Control the image transparency with a precise slider (from 0% to 100%).
- **Move and Resize**: Drag the image anywhere on the screen and freely resize it by pulling its edges.
- **Fine Size Control**:
    - Set the width and height in pixels.
    - Apply a scale (e.g., 1.5x, 2x) to maintain the original proportions.
    - Restore the image's original size with one click.
- **Blend Modes**: Switch between different `mix-blend-mode` options for better overlay visualization, including "Normal", "Overlay", "Difference", and "Exclusion".
- **Lock Position/Size**: Lock the overlay in place to prevent accidental moves and resizes while drawing.
- **Quick Centering**: Instantly center the overlay on the screen.
- **Data Persistence**: All your settings (image, position, size, opacity, blend mode, and lock state) are automatically saved to the browser‚Äôs `localStorage`.
- **Reset Everything**: Clear all settings and remove the overlay to start fresh.
